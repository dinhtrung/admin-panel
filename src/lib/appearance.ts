/** Appearance: a registry of named appearances, resolved in one place.
 *
 *  An appearance is a set of the design system's semantic role tokens (defined in `src/index.css`),
 *  not a code path: adding one means adding a token block and an entry here, and nothing in a
 *  component, screen or shell file changes. The inline script in `index.html` resolves the same
 *  choice before the first paint — it cannot import this module, so it mirrors the id list and says
 *  so; keep the two in step.
